DoNotCompare
============

Rank films and videogames using the Elo algorithm.

This is one of my first PHP projects. The user is shown two random movies (resp. videogames) and is told to select one.
The backend applies the Elo's algorithm to learn from all the users and stablish the ultimate film and videogame rank.
